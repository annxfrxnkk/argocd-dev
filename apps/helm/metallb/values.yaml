# MetalLB settings
# Only overrides - all other values use chart defaults
#
# NOTE: The MetalLB controller is a singleton by design. It has no leader
# election and running multiple instances causes duplicate IP assignments.
# HA comes from the speaker DaemonSet which runs one pod per node and uses
# per-service leader election among speakers. Do NOT scale the controller
# beyond 1 replica.
